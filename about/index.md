Hi!

My name is Artsiom Varnava. I'm from Belarus but currently living in Poland.

I'm working as frontend developer, playing American football, listening and creating music, djing, driving motorcycle and many more... I'm planning to post here useful information, my thoughts, my experience, maybe photos and other things. Looks like it will be trash can for everything, but I will be happy if you'll find something interesting for yourself. I don't know what to add more here for now, so, let's say description is still in progress... :)
